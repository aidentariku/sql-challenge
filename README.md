# sql-challenge
Aiden Tariku's entry for the Week 9 Challenge assignment at the University of Oregon Data Analytics Bootcamp involves executing a series of steps. Firstly, to execute this module, initiate a new database in pgAdmin4. Next, paste and execute the kschultz-SQL-challenge-schema.sql code into the query tool to generate tables essential for the project. Subsequently, import the CSV files from the data folder into the respective tables in the prescribed sequence: titles, employees, departments, dept_manager, dept_emp, and salaries. Following this, execute queries by copying the content of kschults-SQLchallenge-queries.sql into the query tool.
